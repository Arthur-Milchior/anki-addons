This is a quick hack to hide field content only on the desktop client.

<blockquote class="nb">This is an Anki 2.0 plugin. I have no plans of
updating it. People that are interrested in this are welcome to take
this over.</blockquote>


Put fields you don’t want to see on the desktop into
`{%raw%}{{sep:NN}}{%endraw%}` templates, and they become
[somebody else’s problem](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Somebody_Else%27s_Problem_field).

On AnkiWeb and AnkiDroid (and AnkiMobile), the template is unknown and
default behavior is to show the text without modification – the field
becomes visible again.

This is only needed for audio/video files. Text or images can be
hidden with clever CSS:

```html
<span class="justdt">Shown on desktop</span>
<span class="justmobile">Shown on mobile</span>
```

in the card template and
<pre><code>.justmobile {display:none;}
.mobile .justmobile {display:inline;}
.mobile .justdt {display:none;}</code></pre>
in the card CSS.

The problem was that i didn’t want to copy a bunch of video files to
my Android device to save FAT
[directory entries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table#VFAT_long_file_names),
which are in short supply if you have a collection with many files
with long names.
