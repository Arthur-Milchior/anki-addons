<blockquote class="nb">This is an Anki 2.0 plugin. I have no plans of
updating it, as it was obsolete anyway. People that are still
interrested in this are welcome to take this over.</blockquote>

Display a record of a chess position in
[Forsyth–Edwards Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation)
as a chess board.

The FEN record has to be complete (with active player, castling
&amp;c.) and it has to be enclosed in a pair of `[fen]` `[/fen]` tags.

This is the way that can be used on AnkiDroid and, apparently by some
old Anki1 add-on as well.


## Example
Just put ` [fen]n1rb4/1p3p1p/1p6/1R5K/8/p3p1PN/1PP1R3/N6k w - - 0 0[/fen]` on a card.

## Fonts

This add-on does the display without any images. When you don’t see
the chess pieces you should install a font with them. Maybe one from
[here](http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/fonteng.htm)
or
[here](http://www.chess.com/downloads/fonts).

To use a specific chess piece font, use the CSS class `chess_board`,
add a line like `.chess_board {font-family: 'my_chess_piece_font';}`
to your chess note’s styling.

## No development

This was a quick hack. I am neither playing chess nor terribly
interested in this, i just stumbled across the code that does the
equivalent for AnkiDroid. If anybody thinks ey can do a better job,
ey’s welcome to take over this add-on.

## Chess deck

This [shared deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1176122148),
that should work on AnkiWeb as well, can be used instead. While that
deck does not allow black’s view, it is otherwise more flexible.
