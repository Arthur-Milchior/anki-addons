[krassowski](https://github.com/krassowski) has taken over development of this add-on and ported it to Anki 2.1. It is listed as [Zoom2.1](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1846592880) at AnkiWeb, and has its own [github repo](https://github.com/krassowski/Anki-Zoom)

<blockquote class="nb">This page refers to the old Anki 2.0 version.</blockquote>

A simple add-on to zoom in and out the card content (text).  There are
three ways to zoom:

* With Ctrl++/Ctrl+-
* With Ctrl+mouse wheel
* Through the View/Zoom menu.


The zoom is reset when you switch the main screen (change between deck
browser/deck overview/review) or through the menu.

For each main screen, there can be a standard zoom factor set in the
add-on file. Use the Add-ons menu to edit this. (For example, when you
want the deck list in a bigger font, but have the cards themselves set
up all right already.)

This add-on only zooms the text, not images.
