{% raw %}This add-on adds support for furikanji and slightly changes the way
kanji and readings are parsed.

This add-on is for use with the desktop

AnkiWeb may result in suboptimal layout.

<blockquote class="nb">This is an Anki 2.0 plugin. I think i will
update it to 2.1, but don’t know when i will get around to it. If you
are impatient, you can of course do the update yourself. Please let me

## Furikanji

The template `furikanji` uses a standard reading field to
render kanji *above* the kana.

To use this, put  `{{furikanji:Field name}}` instead of
`{{furigana:Field name}}` in the template.

square brackets.">
<figcaption> On AnkiWeb, the furikanji don’t work. </figcaption>
</figure>
As the furikanji rendering is done on the fly by the desktop client,
it does not work with AnkiWeb, AnkiDroid or AnkiMobile. There the text
is rendered as it is seen in the edit screen, with the square
brackets.

<figcaption> AnkiDroid can be patched to use furikanji.  </figcaption>
</figure> Daring spirits can try to merge my [`option-furikanji`](https://github.com/ospalh/Anki-Android/tree/option-furikanji) branch into their AnkiDroid source. It contains the equivalent of this code in the [`FuriganaFilters.java`](https://github.com/ospalh/Anki-Android/blob/option-furikanji/AnkiDroid/src/main/java/com/ichi2/libanki/hooks/FuriganaFilters.java)
file and adds furikanji to AnkiDroid.

This may not work with Android versions < 3.0

## CSS classes

Text that uses the now four templates `furigana`, `furikanji`, `kana`
and `kanji` gets appropriate CSS classes. The `ruby` elements have the
additional classes  `furigana` and `furikanji`; the kana and kanji
texts get wrapped in spans with classes `kana`  and
`kanji`.

See the [complex classes](Complex_classes.html) page for examples on
how to use these classes.


## Furigana, kanji and reading templates

The `{{furigana:Field NN}}`, `{{kanji:Field NN}}` and `{{kana:Field
NN}}` templates have been modified. The standard templates use ASCII
spaces (<q> </q>) and <q>></q> characters to determine the beginning of the
kanji text. The modified version treats only characters in the word
character class as ruby base.

This means that commas, newlines,
[CJK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters)
[spaces](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/3000/index.htm)
&c. can be used as separators between kanji and other, preceding text.

### Limitations

* Leading kana are not automatically separated. For example the
  reading for <q lang="ja">お釣り</q> must still be written with an ASCII space or
  other separator between the <q lang="ja">お</q> and the <q lang="ja">釣</q>: <q lang="ja">お 釣[つ]り</q>.
* As the other functions, this works only on the desktop client.{% endraw %}
