Hide text with the CSS class `browserhide` in the card browser. This
is useful for cards where there is a text repeated for every card.

The effect of this add-on is similar to using the <q>Browser Appearance</q>
feature hidden in the <q>More</q> button of the template editor.

The functionallity of this add-on has been added to the
[Replay button on card](Play_button.html) add-on. There is no need
to install this add-on when the play button add-on is used, too.

<blockquote class="nb">This is an Anki 2.0 plugin. I think i will
publish a 2.1 version after i have updated the play button addon.</blockquote>
