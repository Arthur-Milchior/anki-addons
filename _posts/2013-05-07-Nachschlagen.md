Like the <q>Lookup</q> menu from the Japanese support add-on, this
adds a menu called <q lang="de">Nachschlagen</q> were you can look up
words at some of my favorite resources.

A few of them are German, and the whole add-on is kept in German as
well. <q lang="de">Nachschlagen</q> is German for <q>look up</q>.

<blockquote class="nb">This is an Anki 2.0 plugin. I have no plans of
updating it. People that are interrested in this are welcome to take
this over.</blockquote>

## Set-up

There is a configuration section at the head of the
[source file](https://github.com/ospalh/anki-addons/blob/master/nachschlagen.py)
where a few things can be configured. Most of it is not too important
and explained in the file itself. You may encounter the error message
<q>No field found for look-up. Consider changing the field name lists
in the plugin source.</q> That means that my guesses about what you
use as field names were wrong. In this case you should add your
favorite field names to the `expression_fields` and `meaning_fields`
lists.


## For learners of any spoken language

The <q>Forvo</q> links are useful for learners of any spoken language. Look
up pronunciations at the crowd-sourced [forvo.com](http://forvo.com).

## For learners of Japanese

The kanji look-up at
[saiga-jp.com](http://www.saiga-jp.com/kanji_dictionary.html) may be
useful for learners of Japanese

## For German speakers

The two other resources are more narrowly useful for German speakers:

* [Kanjilexikon](https://mpi-lingweb.shh.mpg.de/kanji/index.html), pretty
  much what it says. A German kanji dictionary.
* [WaDoku](http://www.wadoku.de/), basically *the* Japaneseâ€“German
  online dictionary
