This applies a fix for symptoms caused by an AnkiDroid bug that has long been
fixed. When you see negative review times, either in AnkiDroid or in
the statistics window of the desktop client, download the add-on, run it once and get a new AnkiDroid.

This is in Anki 2.0 style, and will not be updated.
