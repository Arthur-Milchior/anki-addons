Simple add-on that adds play buttons to the cards for audio and video
files.

With this it is possible to replay individual files. For example just
the pronunciation of a word, or just an example sentences.

The button is created as inline SVG and copies the look of the replay
button of newer AnkiDroid versions. The minimum size is set to
12 pixel, otherwise the button is the same size as the text.

<span  class="clear" />

## Styling

<figure>
<img src="images/þéttbýll.png" alt="Anki review window. Large text “þéttbýll
” with a “play” button of the same size and small text “urban” with a small, red play button.">
<figcaption>The replay button can be styled via CSS.</figcaption>
</figure>

The buttons are created on the fly, and their appearance can be
changed via the card templates. It is somewhat tricky to get CSS
right. As an example that can be copied and adapted, to turn only one
replay button red, wrap the field in a span with a class like
`red_button` in the “Front Template” or “Back Template” of the card

{%raw%}
```html
<span class="red_button">{{Audio}}</span>
```
{%endraw%}

Then set `fill` to `red` for `.red_button .replaybutton span svg` in
“Styling”:

```css
.red_button .replaybutton span svg {
  fill: red;
}
```

This kind of styling should be done when using the
[night mode](Local_CSS_and_DIY_night_mode.html) add-on, or you may end
up with black replay buttons on a black background.

<img src="images/urban_shadow.png" alt="“urban” and a red play button
with a shadow effect">
</figure>

On some platforms, CSS filters may work. For example this:

```css
.red_button .replaybutton span svg {
  fill: red;
  -webkit-filter: drop-shadow( 5px 5px 2px #f88 )
}
```
might be used to add a shadow effect.

<span  class="clear" />

## Card browser

The replay button is not shown in the card browser. Instead the sound file names are added to its  list section in the way they are entered into the cards, as `[sound:NN.mp3]` or similar.

### Browserhide
<figure>
<img src="images/browserhide.png" alt="Part of the Anki review window.
Text: みんなの日本語： にんぎょう.  Below part of the Anki card
browser. One line highlighted. Text: 人形; Japanisch-De...; にんぎょう">
<figcaption>The text <q lang="ja">みんなの日本語：</q> is shown on the card,
but not in the browser.</figcaption>
</figure>

The mechanism that is used to hide the play button can also be used to
hide other text repeated on every card.  Put parts of your card
template that should not appear in the card browser into spans with
the class `browserhide`.

The effect of the `browserhide` class is similar to using the
<q>Browser Appearance</q> feature hidden in the <q>More</q> button of
the template editor.

There is another add-on that implements *only* this hiding of text in
the text browser, called [Lean browser qa](Lean_browser_qa.html).

## PNG image version

An [older version](Play_button_png.html) of this add-on
that used an image file is still available at github.
