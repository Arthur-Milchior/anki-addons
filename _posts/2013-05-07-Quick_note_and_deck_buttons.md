This add-on adds a few buttons to the right of the select note type
button and the select deck button at the top of the add card dialog.

Click on them to select your favorite model or note type.

<blockquote class="nb">You will have to modify the add-on source to
adapt this to your deck and model names.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="nb">This is an Anki 2.0 plugin. I have no plans of
updating it. People that are interrested in this are welcome to take
this over.</blockquote>

## Setup

After downloading, you have to modify the `Quick note and deck
buttons.py` file. Trigger the <q>Tools/Add-ons/Open Add-ons
Folder...</q> menu item, pick out that file and open it with your
favorite source editor or trigger <q>Tools/Add-ons/Quick note and deck
buttons/Edit...</q> to use Anki’s built-in editor.

There are two bits of code that should be changed, marked with the
comments `# Set up here...` and `# ... and here.` A knowledge of
[Python](http://www.python.org/)
[syntax](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html) may be helpful
to set this up, but following the examples and only changing text
inside of quotation marks should work.

### Lists of dictionaries

The parts that should be changed are called
[lists](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) of
[dictionaries](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries).
The lists are marked with square brackets, `[` and `]`, the
dictionaries with curly braces, `{` and `}`. Each dictionary describes one
button.

Each of these button dictionaries must contain at least two key–value
pairs:

* A `"label"`. The value after the `:` sets up the name shown in the
  button. Use quotation marks with an extra `u` before them to define
  a unicode string. I would suggest using short texts, such as single
  characters.
* A `"name"`. This is the name of the model in the
  `model_buttons` list and the name of the deck in the `deck_buttons`
  list. Make sure that these names are correct. Cut-and-paste
  the names if possible.


For more options read the comments in the
[source file](https://github.com/ospalh/anki-addons/blob/master/quick_note_and_deck_buttons.py).

## Notes

This add-on was inspired by the “Quick change Note buttons”
add-on. The code is based on that version, by Steve AW. Many thanks,
for the code and also for the idea in the first place.
