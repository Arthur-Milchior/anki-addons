Reactivate two Anki 1 shortcuts:

- *Ctrl+f* card browser
- *Ctrl+w* Deck overview

During reviews, the audio is replayed with the <q>6</q> or <q>i</q>
keys. Those are convenient when using the numpad or a Dvorak keyboard
with the [Dvorak keys](Dvorak_keys.html) add-on.

This add-on is based on
[oldshortcuts.py](https://github.com/dae/ankiplugins/blob/master/oldshortcuts.py),
the
[… Anki 1.2 shortcuts…](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/544525276).
add-on, but it drops Ctr+d for add card.

<blockquote class="nb">This is an Anki 2.0 plugin. I think i will
update it to 2.1, but don’t know when i will get around to it. If you
are impatient, you can of course do the update yourself. Please let me
know which way you want your version published.</blockquote>
