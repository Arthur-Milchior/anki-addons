This is a try to show pop-up tips for kanji.

It appears to not work in the current form.

<blockquote><span class="warn">Caveat:</span>Do not use this add-on.</blockquote>

The add-on uses the Python package lxml, that must be installed by
hand.

For an idea how it is intendet to use, see the source.

This is in Anki 2.0 style, and will not be updated.
