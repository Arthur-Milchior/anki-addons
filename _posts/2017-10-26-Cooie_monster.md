A short add-on that allows the use of cookies set via JavaScript.

I uses this so that a (Japanese) font that is used on the question side is used on the answer side as well.

The “no cookies” setting in the webview is a safety measure. Make sure that the decks you download don’t do nasty things when you use this addon.
