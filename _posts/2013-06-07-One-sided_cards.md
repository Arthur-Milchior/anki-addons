When the back side of a card is exactly `{{FrontSide}}`, go directly
to the back side. This can be used for cards that describe a
task. Like this, you save the time of clicking on the Show Answer
button.

This add-on works somewhat, but there may be a few problems with the
first card. I don't use this, so i will not spend too much time fixing
the problem.

This is in Anki 2.0 style, and will not be updated.
