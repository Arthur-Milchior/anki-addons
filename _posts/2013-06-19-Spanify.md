Another add-on to add buttons to the note editor. This adds buttons to
wrap text in spans.

By default there are three buttons, <q>s1</q>, <q>s2</q> and
<q>s3</q>, that wrap the text selected in a note’s field in `<span
class="styleN">`/`</span>` tags. (`N` = 1, 2, 3). It is up to the user
to set up the card styling to make use these classes.

<blockquote class="nb">
The changes made by the add-on are invisible in the card editor, and
on the cards, unless styling for the classes is added.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="nb">
Unlike the italic or bold buttons, clicking theese buttons twice does
not un-wrap the text, but adds a second span.
</blockquote>

This add-on is based on Thomas Tempé’s
[strikethrough button](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/999886206)
add-on.
